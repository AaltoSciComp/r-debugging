# Debugging R code {#practice}

## Tracing errors

Let's consider the previously showed function example with a missing variable:

```{r, collapse=TRUE, error=TRUE}
# Verify that z is really missing
rm(z)
g <- function(x) {
  return(x + z)
}

f <- function(x,y = g(x)) {
  if (x>0) {
    return(x)
  } else {
    return(g(x))
  }
}
f(-1)
```
This example is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AaltoSciComp/r-debugging/main/examples/missing-variable.R).

Opening the file with Rstudio and sourcing the file will return the following kind of an error:
